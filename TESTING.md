## Validation Testing

The website underwent validation using W3C, WC3 CSS, JSHint JavaScript validator, and [CI PEP8 validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).

### HTML

- HTML W3C Validator Regarding the HTML Validator, it flagged information messages about trailing slashes on void elements, a result of the automatically added /> close tag by Prettier. Manual removal will be addressed in the next file save to rectify this issue.

- Furthermore, there were two errors indicating a stray script tag. Upon investigation, I couldn't locate any such tag. However, upon rechecking the error, I observed that it was actually appearing in the console. I realized that the script tag is related to the Stripe public key in Python files, which cannot be altered through an HTML file.



### CSS

CSS Validator (JigSaw) The CSS Validator Jigsaw was used to validate all the CSS files. There were no errors found.

### JavaScript

JSLint was used to check  for any syntax errors in the JS files, and there were couple of warnings found:
This was something I couldn't resolve, as it could break the code making the var let statements not work as expected.

### Python

I had to rectify certain issues such as characters exceeding 79 and ensuring that there are two lines present between functions. Upon running the Python files through the PEP8 validator, no errors were detected.

## Lighthouse

Google's Lighthouse tool was used to test performance, accessibility, SEO, and PWA aspects of the site. 
The result is as follow:

- I encountered some issues while using the Lighthouse tool to check the website. These included problems with contrast and slow-loading images. To fix this, I converted the images from PNG to WebP format and adjusted the background colour to better complement the white text. Additionally, I cleaned up redundant code in both the CSS and HTML, which improved the overall performance.

- However, there were a few unresolved issues, such as errors in the console related to core code like Stripe and certain buttons in the toast code. 

![console](https://github.com/zaicodes/CushionHaven/blob/main/documentation/testing/console-error.png)

Fixing these errors could potentially break the functionality, so I decided to leave them as is. Another challenge was enabling text compression, but I couldn't find clear instructions on how to do this after following the provided [link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-text-compression).


## Responsiveness and Mobile-Friendliness Testing

Thorough testing was performed on the following devices:

Laptop:
- HP Envy 360

Mobile Devices:
- iPhone 13 Pro
- Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra

In addition, the website was tested on the following browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox

All tests showed that the website is fully responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

- Buttons do not have an accessible name error. This was resolved by adding a title to buttons.
- Fixed issue with contrast as both background and foreground colours were light. This was fixed by changing the background colour on the page to a darker tone. 
- Removed unnecessary area-lable attributes as they were showing error on the validator.
- Removed access JavaScript code and repeated CSS code. 
- Changed span to div for certain elements as this was showing an error on the validator
- Updated image file format from .png to .webp to improve the Lighthouse performance result.
- Fixed issue with the address book as both edit and delete were not functioning, created separate html files to address this.
- Fixed python code according to pep8 as there were several long lines which were adjusted.
- Updated buttons on html files on allauth to have larger font size, padding and margin for better visibility.
- Removed venv. from github files.

### Unsolved Bugs

For the unsolved bugs please refer to the HTML validator and Lighthouse results on this page.
